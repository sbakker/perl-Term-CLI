=head1 NAME

Term::CLI::Element - generic parent class for elements in Term::CLI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Term::CLI::Element;

 my $arg = Term::CLI::Element->new(name => 'varname');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generic parent class for command line elements in L<Term::CLI>(3p).
This is used by L<Term::CLI::Command>(3p) and L<Term::CLI::Argument>(3p)
to provide basic, shared functionality.

This class inherits from L<Term::CLI::Base>(3p) to provide the
C<error>, C<term>, and C<set_error> methods.

=head1 CLASS STRUCTURE

=head2 Inherits from:

L<Term::CLI::Base>(3p).

=head2 Consumes:

None.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=over

=item B<new> ( B<name> =E<gt> I<VARNAME> ... )
X<new>

Create a new Term::CLI::Element object and return a reference to it.

The B<name> attribute is required.

=back

=head1 METHODS

The C<Term::CLI::Element> class inherits accessors
and methods from L<Term::CLI::Base|Term::CLI::Base>(3p).

In addition, it defines:

=over

=item B<complete> ( I<TEXT>, I<STATE> )

Return a list of strings that are possible completions for I<TEXT>.
By default, this method returns an empty list.

Sub-classes should probably override this.

I<STATE> is a C<HashRef> that contains the following elements:

=over

=item B<processed> =E<gt> I<ArrayRef>

More elaborate "parse tree": a list of hashes that represent all the
elements on the command line that have already been processed by parent
(C<Term::CLI::Command>) objects.

Example:

    [
        {
            element => InstanceOf['Term::CLI::Command'],
            value   => 'show'
        },
        {
            element => InstanceOf['Term::CLI::Command'],
            value   => 'info'
        },
        {
            element => InstanceOf['Term::CLI::Argument'],
            value   => 'foo'
        },
        ...
    ]

=item B<unprocessed> =E<gt> I<ArrayRef>

Refers to a list of words leading up to (but not including) the
I<TEXT> that have not yet been processed by parent objects.

For L<Term::CLI::Command> objects this is typically a list of command
line arguments and sub-commands.

For L<Term::CLI::Argument> objects this will be empty.

=item B<options> =E<gt> I<HashRef>

Command line options that have been seen in the input line so far.

=back

For most simple cases, you would only need to examine I<TEXT> (and,
for command objects, the C<unprocessed> list).

The C<processed> list and C<options> hash can be used to implement context
sensitive completion, however.
