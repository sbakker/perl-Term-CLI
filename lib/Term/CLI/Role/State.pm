=head1 NAME

Term::CLI::Role::State - Keep a "state" hash in Term::CLI objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package Term::CLI::CommandSet {

    use Moo;

    with('Term::CLI::Role::State');
 }

 ...

 my $cmd = Term::CLI::Command->new( ... );

 $cmd->state->{'key'} = $val;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Role for L<Term::CLI::CommandSet|Term::CLI::CommandSet>(3p) elements to represent
state across readline operations.

This role is consumed by
L<Term::CLI::CommandSet|Term::CLI::CommandSet>(3p) and thus available
in L<Term::CLI::Command|Term::CLI::Command>(3p) and L<Term::CLI>(3p)
object instances.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This role defines one additional attribute:

=over

=item B<state> =E<gt> I<HashRef>

Reference to an hash containing any information you want.

=back

=head1 ACCESSORS

=over

=item B<state>
X<state>

Return the C<HashRef> representing the state.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<clear_state>
X<clear_state>

Clear the state hash, such that subsequent calls to L<state|/state>
still return the same C<HashRef>, but without any contents.

E.g.:

    my $cli = Term::CLI->new();
    my $hash = $cli->state();

    $cli->state()->{'foo'} = 'foo';
    $hash->{'bar'}         = 'bar';

    say scalar keys %{ $hash };         # prints "2"
    say scalar keys %{ $cli->state };   # prints "2"

    $cli->clear_state();

    say scalar keys %{ $hash };         # prints "0"
    say scalar keys %{ $cli->state };   # prints "0"

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

See F<examples/state_demo.pl> in the source distribution for an example of
how to keep state in the C<Term::CLI> object.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Term::CLI::Command>(3p),

=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<examples/state_demo.pl>

Example script that demonstrates how to keep in the C<Term::CLI> object.

=begin __PODCOVERAGE

=head1 THIS SECTION SHOULD BE HIDDEN

This section is meant for methods that should not be considered
for coverage. This typically includes things like BUILD and DEMOLISH from
Moo/Moose. It is possible to skip these when using the Pod::Coverage class
(using C<also_private>), but this is not an option when running C<cover>
from the command line.

The simplest trick is to add a hidden section with an item list containing
these methods.

=over

=item BUILD

=item DEMOLISH
