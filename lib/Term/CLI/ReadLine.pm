=head1 NAME

Term::CLI::ReadLine - Term::ReadLine compatibility layer for Term::CLI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Term::CLI::ReadLine;

 sub initialise {
    my $term = Term::CLI::ReadLine->new( ... );
    ... # Use Term::ReadLine methods on $term.
 }

 # The original $term reference is now out of scope, but
 # we can get a reference to it again:

 sub somewhere_else {
    my $term = Term::CLI::ReadLine->term;
    ... # Use Term::ReadLine methods on $term.
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a compatibility layer between L<Term::ReadLine>(3p)
and L<Term::CLI>(3p). If L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p) is not loaded as the
C<Term::ReadLine> implementation, this class will compensate for the lack
of certain functions by replacing or wrapping methods that are needed
by the rest of the L<Term::CLI>(3p) classes.

The ultimate purpose is to behave as consistently as possible regardless
of the C<Term::ReadLine> interface that has been loaded.

This class inherits from L<Term::ReadLine> and behaves as a singleton
with a class accessor to access that single instance, because
even though L<Term::ReadLine>(3p) has an object-oriented interface,
the L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p) and L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>(3p) modules
really only keep a single instance around (if you create multiple
L<Term::ReadLine> objects, all parameters and history are shared).

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=over

=item B<new> ( ... )
X<new>

Create a new L<Term::CLI::ReadLine>(3p) object and return a reference to it.

Arguments are identical to L<Term::ReadLine>(3p).

A reference to the newly created object is stored internally and can be
retrieved later with the L<term|/term> class method. Note that repeated calls
to C<new> will reset this internal reference.

=back

=head1 METHODS

See L<Term::ReadLine>(3p), L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>(3p) and/or
L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> for the inherited methods.

=over

=item B<completion_quote_character>
X<completion_quote_character>

In a L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu|Term::ReadLine::Gnu> environment this returns
the C<rl_completion_quote_character>. This value is set during completion
if the text to be completed has an open quote. Consider the case:

    foo 'bar <TAB>

When the completion function is called, the C<rl_completion_quote_character>
will contain a single quote, C<'>.

For non-GNU ReadLine backends, this function returns an empty string.

=item B<echo_signal_char> ( I<signal> )
X<echo_signal_char>

Print the character that generates a particular signal when entered from
the keyboard (e.g. C<^C> for keyboard interrupt).

This method also accepts a signal name instead of a signal number. It only
works for C<INT> (2), C<QUIT> (3), and C<TSTP> (20) signals as these are
the only ones that can be entered from a keyboard.

If L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> is loaded, this method wraps around the method of
the same name in C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> (translating a signal name to a
number first). For other C<Term::ReadLine> implementations, it emulates the
C<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> behaviour.

=item B<readline> ( I<prompt> )
X<readline>

Wrap around the original L<Term::ReadLine's readline|Term::ReadLine/readline>
with custom signal handling, see the
L<CAVEATS section in Term::CLI|Term::CLI/CAVEATS>.

This also calls C<AddHistory> if C<autohistory> is not set in C<Features>.

=item B<term_width>
X<term_width>

Return the width of the terminal in characters, as given by
L<Term::ReadLine>.

=item B<term_height>
X<term_height>

Return the height of the terminal in characters, as given by
L<Term::ReadLine>.

=item B<ignore_keyboard_signals> ( I<SIGNAME>, ... )
X<ignore_keyboard_signals>

Ensure that I<SIGNAME> signals cannot be entered from the
keyboard. I<SIGNAME> should be the name of a signal that
can be entered from the keyboard, i.e. one of:
C<INT>, C<QUIT>, C<TSTP>.

By default, the C<QUIT> keyboard signal is already disabled.

Notes:

=over

=item 1.

This will only disable the keys for the given signals
I<during> a C<readline> operation. Outside of that, they will still
generate signals.

=item 2.

This only disables the keyboard sequences, not the actual signals
themselves (i.e. you can still C<kill -3 PID> from another terminal.

=item 3.

Disabling the C<INT> key will cause I<Ctrl-C> to no longer discard the
input line under L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>; it I<will> discard it under
L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>! It is therefore recommended to just set
C<$SIG{INT}> to C<IGNORE> instead.

=item 4.

Disabling the C<TSTP> key works under L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu>, but
not under L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>. The latter maps the key in raw
mode and explicitly sends a C<TSTP> signal to itself.

=back

See also L<SIGNAL HANDLING|/SIGNAL HANDLING> below.

=item B<no_ignore_keyboard_signals> ( I<SIGNAME>, ... )
X<no_ignore_keyboard_signals>

(Re-)Enable keyboard generation for I<SIGNAME> signals.
See L<ignore_keyboard_signals|/ignore_keyboard_signals> above for
valid I<SIGNAME> values.

=item B<reset_ignore_keyboard_signals>
X<reset_ignore_keyboard_signals>

Reset all keyboard signal generation to the defaults.

=item B<AddHistory> ( I<line>, ... )
X<AddHistory>

=item B<GetHistory>
X<GetHistory>

=item B<ReadHistory> ( I<file> )
X<ReadHistory>

=item B<SetHistory> ( I<line>, ... )
X<SetHistory>

=item B<StifleHistory> ( I<max_lines> )
X<StifleHistory>

=item B<stifle_history> ( I<max_lines> )
X<stifle_history>

=item B<WriteHistory> ( I<file> )
X<WriteHistory>

Depending on the underlying C<Term::ReadLine> implementation, these will
either call the parent class's method, or implement a proper emulation.

In the case of C<Term::ReadLine::Perl>, this means that C<ReadHistory>
and C<WriteHistory> implement their own file I/O read/write (because
C<Term::ReadLine::Perl> doesn't provide them); furthermore, C<StifleHistory>
uses knowledge of C<Term::ReadLine::Perl>'s internals to manipulate the
history.

In cases where history is not supported at all (e.g. C<Term::ReadLine::Stub>,
the history list is kept in this object and manipulated.

=back

=head1 STUB METHODS

If C<Term::ReadLine> is I<not> using the GNU ReadLine library, this object
provides stubs for a few GNU ReadLine methods:

=over

=item B<free_line_state>
X<free_line_state>

=item B<forced_update_display>
X<forced_update_display>

If L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> is loaded, this will use knowledge of
its internals to force an redraw of the input line.

=item B<crlf>
X<crlf>

Prints a newline to the terminal's output.

=item B<replace_line> ( I<str> )
X<replace_line>

If L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> is loaded, this will use knowledge of
its internals to replace the current input line with I<str>.

=item B<deprep_terminal>
X<deprep_terminal>

=item B<prep_terminal>
X<prep_terminal>

If L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> is loaded, this will use knowledge of
its internals to either restore (deprep) terminal settings to
what they were before calling C<readline>, or to set them to what
C<readline> uses. You will rarely (if ever) need these, since
the ReadLine libraries usually take care if this themselves.

One exception to this is in signal handlers: C<Term::CLI::ReadLine>
calls these methods during its signal handling.

=item B<get_screen_size>
X<get_screen_size>

Use C<Term::ReadKey::GetTerminalSize> to get the appropriate
dimensions and return them as (I<height>, I<width>).

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over

=item B<term>
X<term>

Return the latest C<Term::CLI::ReadLine> object created.

=back

=head1 SIGNAL HANDLING

The class sets its own signal handlers in the L<readline|/readline>
function where necessary.

The following signals may be caught:
C<ALRM>, C<CONT>, C<HUP>, C<INT>, C<QUIT>, C<TERM>.

The signal handlers will:

=over

=item *

Restore the terminal to a "sane" state, i.e. the state it was in before
C<readline> was called (the C<CONT> signal being an exception to this
rule).

=item *

If any signal handler was set prior to the call to C<readline>, it will
be called and if control returns L<Term::CLI::ReadLine>'s signal handler,
the terminal will be set back to the state that C<readline> expects it to
be in.

=item *

If the signal handler was previously set to C<DEFAULT>, it is restored
as C<DEFAULT> and the signal is re-thrown, so the default actions (abnormal
exit and possible core dump) can take place.

=back

Just how and when these "wrapper" signal handlers are installed depends on
the selected C<Term::ReadLine> implementation. The
L<Gnu|Term::ReadLine::Gnu> backend doesn't require separate handlers
for signals that are set to C<IGNORE> or C<DEFAULT>. The
L<Perl|Term::ReadLine::Perl> backend does require some wrapping.

The C<INT> signal is always wrapped to ensure that the current input
line is discarded and a newline is emitted.

=head2 Keyboard signals

One subtle difference between the
L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> and L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> is in keyboard-generated
signal handling (interrupt, quit, suspend).

=over

=item *

L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> disables keyboard-generated signals. When it
reads a I<Ctrl-C>, it will send itself an C<INT> signal, when it
sees a I<Ctrl-Z>, it will send a C<TSTP> signal; the "quit" key
I<Ctrl-\> is simply ignored.

=item *

L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> leaves keyboard-generated signals enabled and
sets signal handlers to catch them.

=back

This subtle difference means that:

=over

=item *

It is impossible to have I<Ctrl-\> generate a C<QUIT> signal under
L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>.

=item *

It is impossible to disable I<Ctrl-Z> through L</ignore_keyboard_signals>
under L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>.

=item *

Disabling I<Ctrl-C> through L</ignore_keyboard_signals> will completely
disable I<Ctrl-C> under L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> (will not discard the
input line), but not L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>.

=back

For this reason, the module by default ignores the C<QUIT> key sequence.

=head2 Recommendations

To behave as consistently as possible across the C<Term::ReadLine> backends,
the following is best if you don't want keyboard signals to kill or stop
the program:

=over

=item 1.

Set C<$SIG{INT}> to C<IGNORE>.

=item 2.

Set C<$SIG{TSTP}> to C<IGNORE>.

=item 3.

Ignore keyboard signal C<QUIT> (already default).
